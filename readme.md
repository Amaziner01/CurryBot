# Curry Bot

## Discord Currency Conversion Bot

![CurryBot's Logo](./res/github_thumbnail.png)

CurryBot is my attempt of creating a Discord bot utilizing the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library. 

## Features
- The bot is capable of converting, and listing currency units fetched from an external API using the user's input as commands. 
- It features book-like embeds (It is possible to go through the pages using reactions), ideal for long lists.
- Multi-client support for the book-like embeds; many users can use them concurrently.
- Automatic data update system.

## Commands
### !list
Lists the available currencies.
```
!list
```

### !convert
Converts ammount from one currency unit to another.
```
!convert {AMMOUNT} from {INPUT_CURRENCY} to {OUTPUT_CURRENCY}
```

### !help
Displays the commands mentioned before.
```
!help
```

## Setup
For now, the only two platforms in which the bot have been tested are Linux (Debian 11 Bullseye), and Windows (Windows 10).

### General

Before getting started on the software setup, a new bot should be created create a new bot on the [Discord's Devleloper Portal](https://discord.com/developers).The bot should be allowed to:
- Read and send messages.
- Manage Discord events.

For the bot to work, one of the requirements is to have a `"config.json"` file in the root directory, which contains the keys of the two API's necessary for the bot to work: the Discord Bot's key, generated in the Discord's Developer Portal, and the [APILayer's Currency Data API's](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/currency_data-api) key.



The `"config.json"` file must look like this:

```json
// config.json
{
    "DISCORD_API_KEY": "{YOUR_DISCORD_API_KEY}",
    "CURRENCY_API_KEY": "{YOUR_CURRENCY_API_KEY}"
}
```

After the file is created, we can proceed with the operating system specific setup.

### Windows
- Install Python 3.X.
- Run the `"setup.cmd"` available in the root directory. This file will automatically create a environment based on the installed version available, and install all the dependencies listed in the `"requirements.txt"` file.
- Run the `"./src/main.py"` script utilizing the virtual environment generated by the last step. This can be archieved by running the following commands:
  
```batch
  ./env/Scripts/activate
  python ./src/main.py
```

### Linux
- Install the dependencies `python3`, `python3-pip` and `python3-venv` using the package manager available in your distribution.
- Run the `"setup.sh"` file, that will create a new virtual environment for python, and install the dependencies shown in the `"requirements.txt"` file.
- Run the main `"./src/main.py"` script with the virtual environment's instance of python. Said enviroment could be activated and used to run the script with the following commands:

```batch
  . ./env/bin/activate
  python3 ./src/main.py
```

## Upcomming features

- Logging system to assist debugging.
